<h1>Hi 👋, I'm Sourav</h1>

<h3>
  A self-taught Frontend Developer from India 
</h3>

I love building clean and modern web apps. If an idea comes to my mind, I try to build it and make it real.

My current stack is **React, JavaScript, TypeScript, Tailwind, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB**.  
I enjoy designing UIs, working with APIs, and creating real projects that help me learn faster.

I’m currently working on multiple MERN projects and improving my React skills every day.

Fun Facts:

- I enjoy building websites a lot
- My dream is to get a job and later build my own startup
- I like clean UI and modern animations
